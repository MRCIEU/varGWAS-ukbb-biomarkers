vQTL outcome modifier    notes
rs2076258   calcium.30680.0.0   age_at_menopause.3581.0.0   ?SNP-by-HRT use effect on age at menopause OR Vit D?
rs13141441  alanine_aminotransferase.30620  SNP lowers variance of ALT and is eQTL for drug target HSD17B13; Missense variants in HSD17B13 lower ALT.
rs56009438  alkaline_phosphatase.30610  SNP is associated with smokings and ALP m/v (only analysed chr1)
rs12721030  apolipoprotein_a.30630  SNP is m/v QTL & cis-APOA1
APOB has 3 cis-mvQTL for apolipoprotein_b
rs75984076  aspartate aminotransferase  mvQTL for AST & phewas = SEC31B expression
rs1260326 & rs2889414 are mvQTLs for ApoB and also strongly associated with CRP. CRP IVs associate with ApoB variance
rs2980885 & rs1169297 are mvQTLs for TC and also storngly associate with alkaline phosphatase. Independent IVs ALK associate with TC variance
rs115246607 & rs34872471 are mvQTL for glucose which are strong predictors of metaformin use. Probable interaction with drug use.
rs7121264 is a mvQTL for HDL and also strongly associates with FADS1 expression. Independent instruments for FADS1 predict HDL variance. Possible interaction with linoleic acid as described in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28774683/.
rs12972156 is mvQTL for LDL-c and associated with Alz. Independent instruments for Alz are associated with variance of LDL. Need to stratify by ApoE to check is not driven by a single SNP.
Several mvQTLs for LDL are associated with ALK. Independent instruments for ALK are associated with LDL-c variance.
Several mvQTLs for SHBG are associated with testosterone. Independent instrumentaion of testosterone is associated with variance of SHBG.
Several mvQTLs for urate associated with TG. Independent instruments for TG associated with urate variance.
rs12209125 is a mvQTL for urate and also assocaited with IGF-1, IVs for IGF-1 associated with variance of urate. 
rs1260326 is a mvQTL for urate and associated with SHBG. IVs for SHBG are associated with variance of urate.
rs6811809 is a mvQTL for urate and associated iwth SLC2A9 expression which independent instrumentation of assocaited with variacne of urate. ? interaction with drug use
rs2070895 is a mvQTL for vitamin D and associates with several lipid phenotypes. Independent IVs for these traits assocaited with the variance of vitamin D conc.
rs7979473 is a mvQTL for CRP and also affects expression of HNF1A. Independent expression of HNF1A affects variance of CRP.
rs74842349 is a mvQTL for cystatin C and associates with expression of RRAGD in blood. Independent instruments for  RRAGD associated with cystatin c variance.
rs1471251 is a mvQTL for TG and assocaited with SHBG, independent instruments for SHBG were assocaited with TG
rs10095737, rs35456930 & rs2980885 are mvQTLs for TG and associated with ALK, independent instruments for ALK associated with TG variance.
rs4665378 is a mvQTL for CRP and associated with TG. Independent instruments for CRP associated with variance of TG.
