vQTL outcome modifier    notes
rs2076258   calcium.30680.0.0   age_at_menopause.3581.0.0   ?SNP-by-HRT use effect on age at menopause OR Vit D?
rs13141441  alanine_aminotransferase.30620  SNP lowers variance of ALT and is eQTL for drug target HSD17B13; Missense variants in HSD17B13 lower ALT.
rs56009438  alkaline_phosphatase.30610  SNP is associated with smokings and ALP m/v (only analysed chr1)
rs12721030  apolipoprotein_a.30630  SNP is m/v QTL & cis-APOA1
APOB has 3 cis-mvQTL for apolipoprotein_b
rs75984076  aspartate aminotransferase  mvQTL for AST & phewas = SEC31B expression
rs1260326 & rs2889414 are mvQTLs for ApoB and also strongly associated with CRP. CRP IVs associate with ApoB variance
rs2980885 & rs1169297 are mvQTLs for TC and also storngly associate with alkaline phosphatase. Independent IVs ALK associate with TC variance
rs115246607 & rs34872471 are mvQTL for glucose which are strong predictors of metaformin use. Probable interaction with drug use.
